# Mbay to French/English Neural Machine Translation

The goal of this project is to build a translation model to allow simple and fast translation from French to Mbay, English to Mbay and vice-versa. This model will be integrated in the Mbay translation dictionary available [here](http://mbay.soungadoy.com/).

This specific project covers the following:

* creation of a training and eval dataset
* training and selection of various transformer models using AWS SageMaker and WandB.
* creation of the SageMaker inference endpoint.
